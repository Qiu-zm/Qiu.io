#简介
brief01=$HotDog
brief02=NFT Introduction 
brief03=NFT broke out in the second half of 2020, and is rapidly penetrating into more and more industries. Its applications are growing, including games, art and collectibles, virtual and augmented reality, real estate, event ticketing, brand licensing and the token of real world assets. In March 2021, the NFT artwork "every day: the first 5000 days" created by artist Mike Winkler sold for us $69.34 million, which broke the record of virtual art auction price and accelerated the further popularization of NFT.
brief04=NFT Problem:
brief05=1. Art and collectibles lack of digital forms of expression<br>2. It's hard for NFT creators to get ecosystem support<br>3. The price discovery mechanism is not perfect<br>4. At present, the liquidity of NFT is relatively low
brief06=The outbreak of NFT has accelerated the development of NFT trading platform. For example, opensea, superrare and makersplace have gained a lot of creators and consumers in this wave of NFT outbreak. However, so far, there is no complete ecological NFT exchange going global in the industry

swap06=NFT of traditional IP
swap07=Traditional IP has great traffic and social concern. NFT of traditional IP is one of the main strategies to obtain users in the early stage. It is attractive not only to users in the industry, but also to fans outside the industry and other audience groups. In the first stage, hotdog will explore NFT products related to film and television and entertainment stars, and attract the attention of users in the industry through the attention of fans and empowerment of products, so as to obtain the first batch of seed users. At the same time, we will explore cooperation with well-known artists to meet the needs of user collection and wealth appreciation through their rare and high-quality works. In addition, public welfare activities will be held irregularly at this stage to enhance the influence of the platform industry and expand the range of user groups
swap08=Planning 2
swap09=NFT of industrial chain
swap10=After the first stage of development, hotdog has established a certain industry influence and accumulated a certain user base. Hotdog will study the modes of digital IP rights confirmation, online art circulation and price discovery, and concentrate resources to try to open up the NFT of related products in a single industrial ecology, so that NFT products can flow freely in the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain and improve the operational efficiency of the industrial chain, For example, film and television distribution, big consumption, digital identity, Internet and other fields. Among them, we will focus on exploring the application of NFT in the field of Internet. From the perspective of economics, NFT is a kind of property creation, and it clarifies the ownership relationship. Especially in the era of Internet virtual goods explosion, the ownership of virtual goods cannot be defined, and NFT provides a way to facilitate the development of the Internet from the perspective of property rights. The creation of property rights is good for the economy itself. When the property right is clear, human creative innovation will be more active, and when the property right can be traded in some way, and can guarantee that it will not be copied and tampered with, then the transaction efficiency of human society will be improved.

All valuable mobile non-homogeneous bodies have the necessity of NFT. The improvement of life efficiency will accelerate the process of NFT of goods. At this time, hotdog will no longer be limited by the industrial chain, and will explore the NFT of value, It serves the needs of the digital world, the value flow and the construction of a high-speed "virtual world".
